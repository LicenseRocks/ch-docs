# Authentication

We have two types of authentication tokens:
* Master token (generated by administrator of application instance)
* User token (generated after authentication with wallet or e-mail link)

User has to be redirected to CreatorsHub instance in order to authenticate.
Each call has to to include HTTP header generated and signed by CreatorsHub:

`Authorization: Bearer {JWT}`

Sample request may look as follows:

```
curl --location --request POST '{INSTANCE_URL}/api/public/batchMint' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {JWT}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '[
   {
       "title": "Bear 1",
       "status": "draft",
       "amount": 1
   },
]'
```

## Obtaining the API Token

The endpoint is secured by the API Token attached to the User who generated the token.
In order to generate the token log in to our Instance, go to `Settings`, find `API Access` under `Settings` list, go to the `Marketplace API` tab and click the `Generate token` button or grab the Token if you already generated one.
