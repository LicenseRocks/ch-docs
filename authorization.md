# Authorization

We have two types of authentication tokens:
* Master token (generated by administrator of application instance)
* User token (generated after authentication with wallet or e-mail link)

User has to be redirected to CreatorsHub instance in order to authenticate.
Each call has to to include HTTP header generated and signed by CreatorsHub:

`Authorization: Bearer {JWT}`

Sample request may look as follows:

```
curl --location --request POST '{INSTANCE_URL}/api/public/batchMint' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {JWT}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '[
   {
       "title": "Bear 1",
       "status": "draft",
       "amount": 1
   },
]'
```
