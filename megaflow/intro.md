# Megaflow

Would you like to create simple and efficient workflows inside your app, by providing only JSON schema? This repo contains solution for your problem.
![](../static/logo.png)

## What is it?

MegaFlow is a React component dedicated to build workflows based on JSON schemas, powered by React Hook Forms.

As there are multiple workflows to generate in the company, which all of them are custom, also can be modified, we decided to have a component which will be used across all of our projects, so that it is possible to keep consistency along them.

## Main libraries/technologies used in MegaFlow:

Below you can find main libraries/technologies which we have used in Megaflow.
All other libraries are used by basing on design needs. Moreover, there is an example (story) which shows how this component works, based on provided schema in Storybook.

![](../static/rhf.png)
![](../static/styled-components.png)

- Storybook Shortly, it is a development playground. We use it as an environment for components development. Also we build and deploy it to Github Pages as a showcase for the components we have.

- Styled-Components CSS-in-JS library which we use to make style neatly arranged through every component

- Material-UI Most of the components are built on top of MUI, it lets us save significant amount of time, since we do not need to write everything from scratch

- React-Hook-Form Form elements are implemented in a way to be compatible with RHF, as it's one of the best form libraries for React.

## How to use Megaflow:

1. Like you do for any other JS lib or package, just run `yarn add @licenserocks/mega-flow`
2. Import the component `<MegaFlow />` in your app and use that like in example below

```jsx
import React from "react";
import schema from "./sample.json";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <MegaFlow schema={schema} />
    </>
  );
};
```

Part of schema example

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "rows": [
        {
          "label": "Title",
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "title",
              "required": "Name is required",
              "placeholder": "Name of your listed image"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "title": "License Metrics"
    }
  ]
}
```

Good practce: Visit a storybook for this project, and check which props you can pass to imported component 👇
https://licenserocks.github.io/mega-flow

## Props 👨‍🔧

- defaultValues 👉 values rendered as default in provided schema
- icons 👉 additional icons which are included in form
- schema 👉 json file, the core of a form
- onFinish 👉 function executed at the end of a form
- onStepSubmit 👉 function executed on concrete step
- renderActionButtons 👉 additional buttons passed to the end of a form
- theme 👉 theme variables used in styling part
- watcher 👉 function which is executed to show declared variables in `inspect mode`
- watchList 👉 array of string variables shown in `inspect mode`
- wizardProps 👉 props passed directly to `Wizard component`
- wrapperProps 👉 props passed directly to `Wrapper component`

## How MegaFlow works ✍️

There is a sample schema file in `src` folder which is named `sample.json` and it is used in the Storybook for testing and developing purposes. You can also refer to it to see how the schema works in different situations.

MegaFlow parses provided schema file and builds form basing on this data. Below is the most fundamental example of parsing JSON 👇

```js
const json = '{"result":true, "count":42}';
const obj = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj.count);
// expected output: 42

console.log(obj.result);
// expected output: true
```

Returning to MegaFlow parsing, this process is made by getting firstly, entire `schema` as `parsedchema`, then `steps` data is isolated from it, so that it is possible to render correctly complex forms with multiple steps.

```jsx
// Parse if schema was type of JSON string
const parsedSchema = typeof schema === "string" ? JSON.parse(schema) : schema;
const { steps } = parsedSchema;
```

How MegaFlow displays form based on parsed schema?

Basing on `{steps}` generated from `parsedSchema`, imported `Form` component is included in function `renderForm`,

```jsx
import { Form } from "./components";

const [wizardData, setWizardData] = useState({});
const stepFormData = wizardData[currentStep] || defaultValues;

const stepsArray = steps.map((st) => ({
  title: st.title,
}));

const renderForm = () => (
  <Form
    data={steps[currentStep]}
    key={currentStep}
    stepIndex={currentStep}
    stepFormData={stepFormData}
    defaultValues={defaultValues}
  />
);
```

which is passed further to `Wizard` component as `currentStepContent`. There was also created an array which contains steps titles, so that it can be easily displayed in `Wizard`

```jsx
<Wizard
  currentStepContent={renderForm()}
  currentStepIndex={currentStep}
  renderActionButtons={() => renderActionButtons(getOutputData(wizardData))}
  setCurrentStepIndex={setCurrentStep}
  steps={stepsArray}
  {...wizardProps}
  {...props}
/>
```

Imported `Form` component is build mostly on Rockskit library, it seperates from passed `data` concrete `rows` and renders it in similar way as `renderForm` function.

To collect data from current step, MegaFlow uses `wizardData` variable which is passed to `Wizard` component. This component is imported from `rockskit`.

```jsx
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0);
const isCurrentLastStep = currentStep === steps.length - 1;
const [wizardData, setWizardData] = useState({});
const stepFormData = wizardData[currentStep] || defaultValues;
```

`currentStep` is set to indicate first step, to start proceeding form at the beginning
`stepFormata` is getting values from `wizardData` at concrete step or passed `defaultValues`

```jsx
const getOutputData = (output) =>
  Object.values(output).reduce((obj, acc) => ({ ...obj, ...acc }), {});

const onSubmit = (data) => {
  const currentState = {
    ...wizardData,
    [currentStep]: data,
  };

  // Set step data in global wizard object
  setWizardData(currentState);

  if (!isCurrentLastStep) {
    setCurrentStep((prev) => prev + 1);
  } else {
    onFinish(getOutputData(currentState));
  }
};
```

Submitting is executed by a function `onSubmit`, this function firstly, declares constant variable `currentState` which contains previously passed `wizardData` and `data` collected from current step. Then `wizardData` is updated end form displays next step or executes `onFinish` function.

## How to create a correct schema? 🙋‍♂️

As it can be seen in `How it works` part, schema should be divided into `steps` and then `rows`. It is the way how it is rendered and displayed, depending on the content of each row. MegaFlow using `Wizard` component shows each row content.

Let's look deeper on example json schema.

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "rows": [
        {
          "hint": "Supported file types: image/* (jpg, png, jpeg) - Max size: 2MB",
          "label": "Cover",
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "cover",
              "type": "fileUpload",
              "accept": "image/*",
              "multiple": false,
              "required": "You must upload image cover"
            }
          ],
          "labelAlign": "start",
          "labelGutter": true
        }
      ],
      "title": "Media Assets"
    },
    {
      "rows": [
        {
          "label": "Title",
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "title",
              "required": "Name is required",
              "placeholder": "Name of your listed image"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "title": "License Metrics"
    }
  ]
}
```

To understand how `rows` are rendered into exact form, it is neccessary to dive into `Wizard` component, which is imported from Rockskit package 👉 https://github.com/LicenseRocks/rockskit and `/Form` folder in `MegaFlow`

Displayed content in `Wizard` is declared as a component `WizardStepContent`, it is shown below 👇

```jsx
const content = (
  <WizardStepContent
    content={steps[currentStepIndex]?.content || currentStepContent}
    //other props
  />
);
```

Like it is coded, content is declared as an array of `steps` content attribute or `currentStepContent` passed before as a function `renderForm()`

Declared above `content` as `WizardStepContent` is executed in the place which depends on `orientation` prop, passed to `Wizard` as `wizardProps`. By default it has a value `horizontal`

If the place of rendered form is known (how it depends of orientation prop), let's jump into `Form` component 👇

```jsx
const Form = ({ data, defaultValues, stepIndex, stepFormData }) => {


  const renderRows = (index) => (
    <FormRows
      data={data}
      index={index}
      isRecurring={isRecurring}
      rows={data.rows}
      stepIndex={stepIndex}
      stepData={stepFormData}
    />
  );

//further part of a file
```

Data converted into a form is passed by props `stepFormData` and `data` into `renderRows` function, mainly into `FormRows` component.

`FormRows` component renders the data, all rows are mapped and fields are passed to `FormField` component and other variables such as `hint`, `label` displayed to the user as a custom component imported from `Rockskit`.

To see how fields are generated, it is crucial to see which `fieldType` prop should be passed in schema. It is perfectly and understandable represented in `mapFieldTypeToComponent` variable.

```jsx
const mapFieldTypeToComponent = (fieldType) => {
  switch (fieldType) {
    case "datepicker":
      return FormDatepicker;
    case "select":
      return Select;
    case "borderedRadio":
      return BorderedRadio;
    case "checkbox":
      return Checkbox;
    case "radio":
      return Radio;
    case "toggleSwitch":
      return ToggleSwitch;
    case "fileUpload":
      return FileUpload;
    case "filePond":
      return FilePond;
    case "price":
      return PriceField;
    case "reactSelect":
      return ReactSelect;
    case "stepper":
      return Stepper;
    case "textArea":
      return TextArea;
    default:
      return Input;
  }
};
```

Each represented `fieldType` generates proper component from `rockskit` and is displayed to the user 😍

To sum up: If you are wondered how to create correct json schema, divide it into steps, then rows and follow `Form` and `Field` files to pass proper values 😉

## How to go through process of builiding and packaging MegaFlow? 🧑🏻‍💻

We use Rollup for this process. It is configured in a way to use Babel to transpile the code and export the package in two formats: ESModules and CommonJS.

Now imagine we want to update a code in one of the components:

1. Update the component code and make sure everything is working, at least in Storybook. If needed, update the code of component story in `stories.js` file.
2. Begin the building process by running `yarn build` and make sure, that build phase passes successfully and we have updated files in `dist` directory.
3. Update the version of package either manually or using `npm version` (better to do it manually).
4. Make sure you have an access to @licenserocks packages using your npm account, then run `npm login` to complete authentication process.
5. Now run `npm publish`. Keep in mind that you should have configured your npm CLI before running this command. Then use `npm login` to login into your account. For more information about how to login to NPM, visit this link: https://docs.npmjs.com/logging-in-to-an-npm-enterprise-registry-from-the-command-line .
6. Commit your changes and push to Github repository.

That's all!🚀

## Running Locally 🏡

To run Rockskit with full view through storybook on localhost, follow steps below 👇

1. Clone repo to your machine, by running `git clone <remote url>`
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn`
3. Run on your local by `yarn start`

You can start modifying MegaFlow now 😉

## Configuration ⚙️

If it is super important to change some configurations for Babel or Rollup, it can be done carefully by editing `rollup.config.js` and `babel.config.js` files.
