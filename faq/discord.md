# Discord

## What is Discord?

Discord is a standalone online service for instant messaging, chat, voice conferencing and video conferencing and is not owned by twelve by twelve. Discord is used as a community meeting place in the crypto and NFT scene. On our Discord you will find the twelve x twelve community which consists of NFT-interested and -enthusiasts, artists, musicians. Feel free to drop by and exchange ideas with other community members!

## How do I join the license.rocks Discord server?

To join the Discord, you can click on the link on our website or use this one. To use the full scope of our Discord server, accept the rules in our rules channel. Every channel has a short description of what to post in it and what not. Feel free to explore and to start a new conversation!

## Do you save my Log In data?

No. Discord functions as a stand-alone application that must adhere to the respective privacy policies.

## How can I use my Access Token NFTs to enter private Discord channels?

After you successfully purchased a NFT that contains an Access Token functionality, you can simply connect your license.rocks marketplace account to your discord account. This way you’re allowing Discord to verify your NFTs and grant you access to private channels on our server. To do this, please click the “Connect to Discord” button in your private section on the marketplace. There will be a popup by Discord asking you to allow the connection. There is no confidential information shared with us by any means. We provide Discord with the information of what NFTs you currently own, so you get automatically assigned to specific roles by Discord, which grant you access to private channels.
