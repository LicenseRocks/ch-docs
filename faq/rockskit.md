# Rockskit

## What is Rockskit?

RocksKit is a license.rocks GmbH design system components for React.js.
As there are multiple projects in the company, which all of them are sharing the same design, we decided to have a component library to be used across all of those projects, so that it is possible to keep consistency along them.
