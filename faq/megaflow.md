# Megaflow

## What is MegaFlow?

MegaFlow is a React component dedicated to build workflows based on JSON schemas, powered by React Hook Forms.
As there are multiple workflows to generate in the company, which all of them are custom, also can be modified, we decided to have a component which will be used across all of our projects, so that it is possible to keep consistency along them.
