**RocksBot** comes with out-of-the-box logging functionality. But what do we mean with saying *"logging"?*

Everyone likes to see that everything is working correctly, especially after doing some action. **RocksBot**, apart from notifying the user who executed specific command, has a built-in feature to log every action and send it to your Discord channel!

Simply create an channel on your Discord server and name it exactly `rocksbot-logs`. From now on, the **RocksBot** will send all the notifications to this channel!


!!!secondary  :bulb: **Tip**

You can easily adjust who from your server is able to see the logs by adding either role or someone specific to the channel scoped permissions
